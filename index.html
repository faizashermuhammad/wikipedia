    <h1>Criticism</h1>

    <a href="#">John T. Reed,</a> a critic of Robert Kiyosaki, says, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad contains much wrong advice, much bad advice,
    some dangerous advice, and virtually no good advice." He also states, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad is one of the dumbest financial
    advice books I have ever read. It contains many factual errors and numerous extremely unlikely accounts of events that
    supposedly occurred."[11] Kiyosaki provided a rebuttal to some of Reed's statements.[12] Slate reviewer
    <a href="#">Rob Walker</a> called the book full of nonsense, and said that Kiyosaki's claims were often vague, the narrative "fablelike",
    and that much of the book was "self-help
    <a href="#">boilerplate",</a> noting the predictable common features of such books were present in Rich Dad, Poor Dad. He also criticizes
    Kiyosaki's conclusions about Americans, American culture, and Kiyosaki's methods.[1]

    <h2>Publishing success</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The book was originally self-published in 1997 before being picked up commercially to become a
        <a href="#"> New York Times</a> bestseller. It has since sold over 32 million copies and become a household name.[13] In his audiobook
        Choose to be Rich, Kiyosaki said that every publisher turned him down, and Barnes & Noble refused to stock the book
        initially. He places his focus upon talk shows and radio show appearances, of which
        <a href="#"> The Oprah Winfrey Show </a> the biggest influence on book sales.[14] On April 2017 a 20th Anniversary edition of
        Rich Dad, Poor Dad was published and in a preface to this 20th Anniversary edition
        <a href="#"> Robert T. Kiyosaki</a> asserts that an estimated 40 million copies of the book had been sold worldwide.[15]
